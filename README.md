# MOOC_Data_Science_and_Engineering_with_Apache_Spark
The Data Science and Engineering with Spark XSeries, the Edx MOOC which covers how to perform data science and data engineering at scale using Spark, a cluster computing system well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks. It will also present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of data analysis pipelines, including exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning, and model evaluation.

The Git repository is an archive of all PySpark notebooks on courses of this Series. Feel free to contact the author (hieupm.it90@gmail.com) or leave a comment to clarify any point in the productions.
